# Do Random Numbers Have Cycles?

This is a simple, interactive, single-page website that explores an intriguing idea in probability:  
**Are cycles in population data always meaningful, or can they appear naturally in pure randomness?**

## üìö The Idea

Many animal populations show natural boom-and-bust cycles ‚Äî for example, some species exhibit a 3-year population peak.  
But if you generate a sequence of random numbers and look for local peaks (points higher than their neighbors), you‚Äôll find that on average, peaks appear every 3 points.

This means some ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù in data can arise purely by chance ‚Äî an important lesson for science, data analysis, and pattern recognition!

## üìà What This Page Shows

- Generates 1,000 random numbers.
- Identifies all local peaks.
- Computes the average distance between peaks (which approaches 3).
- Animates the peaks appearing on an interactive Plotly chart.
- Includes an engaging story to explain the concept and its implications.

## üìÇ How to Use

- All the code is in `RandomStory.html` ‚Äî it‚Äôs fully self-contained.
- Open `RandomStory.html` in any web browser to view it.
- Or host it with GitHub Pages for a public link.

## üß© How It Works

The page uses:
- **HTML, CSS, and Plotly.js** for the interactive graph.
- Simple fade-in animation for a clean, modern feel.
- A short story to make the data science concept clear and memorable.

## ‚ú® What You Can Learn

> Patterns in data aren‚Äôt always evidence of a deep law of nature.  
> Sometimes, randomness alone creates trends that look significant!

Always test your patterns ‚Äî and remember the power of randomness.
